# SHnake
A basic snake game written in BASH Script.
We are the 90â€™s kids so each one of us must have played the SNAKE GAME once in our life. What about making one for yourself. Relax you are not required to make the whole snake game but just a part of it.
1) You are required to move the snake in any of the four directions using the arrow keys.  
2) The length of the snake can increase periodically. The rate at which the length of the snake increases can be set by you just make sure it looks fine. 
3) When the snake reaches the end of any of the four sides of the terminal then It should  Restart from middle. 
4) The colour of the snake should change for every change in direction randomly.
5) The snake will die and restart at the center if it eats itself.
